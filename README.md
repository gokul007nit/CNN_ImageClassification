# CNN_ImageClassification
This project is a deep learning model using CNNs to classify images of cats and dogs. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, it includes data preprocessing, model training with dropout and batch normalization, and visualizes training performance with accuracy/loss graphs. It serves as a simple and effective intro to binary image classification.
